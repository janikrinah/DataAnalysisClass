    "* <span>The **key dependent variables** are:\n",
    "  1. Fossil fuel electricity share\n",
    "  2. Renewable energy electricity share </span>\n",

    "  1. Low-income\n",
    "  2. Lower-middle income\n",
    "  3. Upper-middle income\n",

    "* <span>Each case represents either a country, region or income-level grouping for a specific year.\n",
